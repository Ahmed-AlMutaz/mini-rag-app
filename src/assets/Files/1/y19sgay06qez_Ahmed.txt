I am an AI Engineer specializing in building practical, scalable, and high-impact solutions across Machine Learning, Deep Learning, NLP, and Computer Vision. I focus on transforming theoretical concepts into real-world applications through clean engineering practices, structured experimentation, and end-to-end model development. My work emphasizes solving real problems using data-driven methods, designing robust pipelines, and deploying intelligent systems that deliver measurable value. I enjoy working on challenging projects that require analytical thinking, creativity, and a strong understanding of modern AI architectures and tools. I am known for being dedicated, adaptable, and detail-oriented. I learn quickly, embrace new technologies, and consistently aim to deliver solutions that balance accuracy, performance, and practical usability. In addition to my work, I am also an educational content creator with more than 200 videos explaining AI and Computer Science concepts to learners.
